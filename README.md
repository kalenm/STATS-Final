# The Project

This is a copy of my final project from MATH 834. The data files each contain a set of randomly generated points that have had some noise added to them, with each file related to a different type of noise.

Then for each different type of noise that had been added to the system, I looked at different methods of bootstraping to compare how well each method works against different types of noise. For a full write-up look in the Write up html file.
Along with the write up there is a copy of all the code I used for the processing.
